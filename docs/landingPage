### Client Perspective ðŸ“ˆ

From a client's point of view, features are about achieving business goals like lead generation, sales, and brand awareness.

#### **Basic**
These are the must-have elements for any functional landing page.

### Developer Perspective ðŸ’»

From a developer's standpoint, features are about the technology, architecture, and integrations needed to build and maintain the page. I'll frame this using your preferred tech stack: **Laravel, Vue 3, Inertia, and Tailwind CSS.**

#### **Basic**
This covers building a simple, static, yet effective landing page.
* **Single Vue Component:** The entire page is built within a single, self-contained Vue component.
* **Static Content:** All text and images are hardcoded directly into the component.
* **Tailwind CSS Styling:** All styling is handled with Tailwind CSS utility classes for a responsive, mobile-first design.
* **Standard Laravel Form Handling:** A basic HTML form that submits to a Laravel controller method, with server-side validation.
* **Blade Layout:** The Vue component is rendered within a simple Laravel Blade layout file.

#### **Advanced**
This involves creating a more dynamic and maintainable single-page application (SPA) experience.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** The page is broken down into smaller, reusable Vue components (e.g., `CtaButton.vue`, `TestimonialCard.vue`).
* **Inertia.js for SPA-like Feel:** Using Inertia to handle form submissions asynchronously without a full page reload, providing a smoother user experience.
* **Props for Content:** Page content (text, image URLs) is passed down from the Laravel controller to the Vue components as props, separating content from structure.
* **Database Integration:** Leads are saved to a database using an Eloquent model and migration.
* **Third-Party API Integration:** Using Laravel's HTTP Client to send lead data to an external service (e.g., an email marketing platform API).
* **Asset Bundling:** Using Vite to compile and optimize all CSS and JavaScript assets.

#### **Expert / Enterprise**
This focuses on scalability, performance, SEO, and integration with complex business systems.
* **Headless CMS Integration:** Fetching page content dynamically from a Headless CMS (like Strapi or Contentful) so the marketing team can update content without developer intervention.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Implementing Inertia SSR to improve initial page load times and boost SEO performance.
* **A/B Testing Framework:** Building logic in the Laravel backend to serve different component variations to different users and track the results.
* **Job Queues:** Offloading heavy tasks (like sending emails or syncing with a CRM) to a Laravel queue worker to ensure the user gets an instant response.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Setting up an automated pipeline (e.g., with GitHub Actions) to test and deploy changes to the landing page automatically.
* **Advanced Caching:** Implementing caching strategies (e.g., with Redis) for CMS content and other data to ensure maximum performance.
* **Custom API Development:** Building a robust API within Laravel to serve the landing page and handle complex integrations with internal enterprise systems.
